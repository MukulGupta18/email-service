Email Service Project
This project implements a resilient email sending service with features like retry logic, idempotency, rate limiting, and a simple queue system. It is built using TypeScript/JavaScript.

Project Structure
src/: Contains the source code for the email service.

utils/: Utility classes such as rate limiter, idempotency manager, and retry logic.
EmailProvider.ts: Interface for email providers.
MockEmailProvider1.ts: A mock email provider with a 50% chance of failure.
MockEmailProvider2.ts: A second mock email provider with a 50% chance of failure.
EmailService.ts: The main email service implementation that utilizes the email providers and utilities.
EmailQueue.ts: A simple queue system that processes email sending requests.
tests/: Contains unit tests for the different components of the service.

Features
Retry Logic: Implements exponential backoff retry logic to handle transient failures.
Idempotency: Ensures the same email is not sent multiple times.
Rate Limiting: Limits the rate of email sending to avoid overwhelming the email provider.
Queue System: A basic queue to manage email sending requests.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js (>=14.x)
npm or yarn
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-service.git
cd email-service
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn install
Run the tests:

bash
Copy code
npm test
# or
yarn test
Run the service:

bash
Copy code
npm start
# or
yarn start
Usage
To use the email service, you can enqueue email sending requests to the service's queue. The service will handle retries, rate limiting, and idempotency checks.

Deployment
The project can be deployed on platforms like Vercel. The .vercel directory is created when you link the project to Vercel and contains the necessary configuration.

Deployment Instructions
Install Vercel CLI:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g vercel
Deploy the project:

bash
Copy code
vercel
If you encounter an error related to project settings, delete the .vercel folder and try linking the project again.

Assumptions
The email sending feature is designed to simulate with mock providers, and does not actually send real emails.
The retry logic assumes a 50% failure rate for demonstration purposes.
This project is a conceptual implementation intended to demonstrate resilience patterns in email sending services.
Known Issues
The .vercel folder should not be committed to the repository as it contains sensitive project configuration.
